There are Various ways to prevent phishing attacks:
- **Use of SSL certificates** - Ensure the websites you visit use HTTPS, especially for sensitive transactions.
- **Double check the URL** - Hover over links to see the actual URL before clicking. Make sure it matches the legitimate website.
- **Beware of Urgent Requests** - Phishers often create a sense of urgency; be cautious when asked for immediate action
- **Regularly Monitor Accounts** - Keep an eye on our online accounts for any unauthorized activity and turn on 2FA and notifications for logins.

- NFT Details are as follows
```
{
"metamask_public_address": "0x876d0770426B0F5388a8E961D407e9ffd1Fc2584",
